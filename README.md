Stack:
- React
- Firebase


## User stories
- Users can choose a nickname
- Users can join chatrooms of their own choosing
- Users can send messages to other users

## Features
- Mobile-friendly UI (Semantic-UI)
- Stores messages on the server (only messages from channels are saved at the moment, but it's quite easy to extend it to support private messages also)
- Supports multiple logged clients at the same time from one user (e.g. desktop & mobile clients)
- Keeps list of online users in real time

* Considering using CSS-in-JS, e.g. [styled-components](https://styled-components.com)
* Optimization
  * More advanced webpack config
  * Prerendering
  * Code splitting
