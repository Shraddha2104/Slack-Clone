Stack:
- React
- Firebase


## User stories
- Users can choose a nickname
- Users can join chatrooms of their own choosing
- Users can send messages to other users

## Features
- Mobile-friendly UI (Semantic-UI)
- Stores messages on the server (only messages from channels are saved at the moment, but it's quite easy to extend it to support private messages also)
- Supports multiple logged clients at the same time from one user (e.g. desktop & mobile clients)
- Keeps list of online users in real time

Possible future improvements:
* Refactor both server & client side code
* Add front end specific tests with e.g. [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), [enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
* Considering using CSS-in-JS, e.g. [styled-components](https://styled-components.com)
* Optimization
  * More advanced webpack config
  * Prerendering
  * Code splitting

## Anything else?

Remember the rules!

It's _not_ about:

- how good your code is,
- how novel the idea is, or
- how useful the project is.

It _is_ about:

- **Impressive**: People's wows are on record!
- **Design**: Slick UI with search and a snappy bot 24/7!
- **Learning**: React, CORS and auth are always tough!
- **OSS practices**: Plentiful commits, branches, PRs!
